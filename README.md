Github Commit Finder is a website that helps you find commits of a repository with date and time filter. The result will be a list of commits in the form of commit cards and it contains enough information for you to checkout that specific commit and see what's changed.

This project was developed primarily on **React.js** (with Vanilla JS), **Bootstrap 5**, a little bit of **CSS5** and **HTML**.

# Features
🔵 You can search for specific commits of a repo of a user, both public and private (for private repositories I must be a collborator of that repo).

🔵 The list of filtered commits will be shown as commit cards.

🔵 Each commit card contains the following information of that commit

   ▶ Date and time
   
   ▶ Latest commit badge
   
   ▶ Commit sha256
   
   ▶ Commit message
   
   ▶ A button that redirects you to the commit page
