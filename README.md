Dota 2 Heroes is a web project that mimics Dota 2 official heroes detail [site](https://www.dota2.com/heroes/) in term of filtering heroes, hovering on each of them and each hero's detail page. The hero cards is inspired by the in-game hero picking screen.

This project was developed primarily on **React.js** (with Vanilla JS), **CSS5** and **HTML**. I recently converted all the JS code to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (for statically type-checking).
